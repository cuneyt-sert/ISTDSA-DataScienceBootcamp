# NEW YORK SUBWAY TURNSTÄ°LE DATA

The subject of our project was as follows:

The WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) association has an annual gala at the beginning of summer each year is organizing.

The purpose of the gala is to increase women's participation in technology, and for this, they want to reach the audience they will address by placing street teams at the entrances of the New York Subway station. Our job is to use MTA subway turnstile data to make suggestions about the locations of the teams so as to reach the maximum number of people who can attend the gala.

Our source for MTA data is: http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html 

Since it was stated that the time of the gala will be in the early summer of 2023, I thought we could work on the early summer data of 2022 as a sample data set. 
The data set consists of the data transferred to the system on Saturdays every week, and I worked on the 10-week data set containing the range 220402-220604.
