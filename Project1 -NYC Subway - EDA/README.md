The subject of our project was as follows:

The WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) association has an annual gala at the beginning of summer each year is organizing.

The purpose of the gala is to increase women's participation in technology, and for this, they want to reach the audience they will address by placing street teams at the entrances of the New York Subway station. Our job is to use MTA metro data to make suggestions about the locations of the teams so as to reach the maximum number of people who can attend the gala.
